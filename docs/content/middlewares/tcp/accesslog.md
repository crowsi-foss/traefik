# TCP Access Logging

Traefik now supports access logging for TCP connections, including mTLS (mutual TLS) client certificate details. This feature is enabled automatically when the global access log is configuredâ€”no additional configuration is required for TCP access logs beyond enabling access logging in your static configuration.

## How It Works
- When access logging is enabled (via the `accessLog` section in your static configuration), Traefik will log all incoming TCP connections on all TCP entrypoints.
- The TCP access log includes connection metadata such as source/destination IPs, bytes sent/received, connection duration, and (if mTLS is used) client certificate subject, serial number, and issuer.
- The log format and file path are inherited from the global access log configuration.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
entryPoints:
  mytcp:
    address: ":9000"
    # No need to add anything here for access logging

accessLog:
  filePath: "/var/log/traefik/access.log"
  format: json
```

## Log Fields
Each TCP access log entry contains:
- `timestamp`: Connection start time
- `entryPoint`: Name of the entrypoint
- `remoteAddr`: Client IP and port
- `localAddr`: Traefik IP and port
- `bytesReceived`: Total bytes received from client
- `bytesSent`: Total bytes sent to client
- `duration`: Connection duration in milliseconds
- `mtlsSubject`: (if mTLS) Subject of client certificate
- `mtlsSerialNumber`: (if mTLS) Serial number of client certificate
- `mtlsIssuer`: (if mTLS) Issuer of client certificate

## mTLS Details
If the client presents a certificate (mTLS), the following fields are included:
- `mtlsSubject`: Distinguished Name (DN) of the client certificate subject
- `mtlsSerialNumber`: Serial number of the client certificate
- `mtlsIssuer`: Distinguished Name (DN) of the certificate issuer

## Notes
- TCP access logging is always enabled for all TCP entrypoints when access logging is enabled globally.
- No additional configuration is required for TCP access logs.
- The log format (JSON, CLF, etc.) and file path are shared with HTTP access logs.

## Example Log Entry (JSON)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T12:34:56Z",
  "entryPoint": "mytcp",
  "remoteAddr": "203.0.113.42:54321",
  "localAddr": "192.0.2.10:9000",
  "bytesReceived": 1024,
  "bytesSent": 2048,
  "duration": 1500,
  "mtlsSubject": "CN=client,O=Example Corp",
  "mtlsSerialNumber": "01A2B3C4D5E6F7",
  "mtlsIssuer": "CN=Example CA,O=Example Corp"
}
```
